# people-count-vino
This project uses Python and OpenVINO toolkit for counting the number of people in a given frame. <br>
OpenVINO toolkit is used for faster inference.<br>
It uses a MobileNetV2-like backbone model. <br>


## OpenVINO Toolkit Setup 

#### Installation Guide <br>

#### Getting Started Guide <br>

## Directory Structure 

```
.
├── inference.py
├── output_snapshots
├── people_count.py
└── resources
    └── config.json

2 directories, 3 files

```
`people_count.py` - It is the python program which counts the number of people in a given frame. <br>
`inference.py` - It is a python program which contains the OpenVINO specific code. <br>
`config.json` - It is a json file which determines the source of the video. You can specify the url to a video file or your webcam id. <br>

## Executing the Program 

### Step 1 - 
Run the following command to activate the OpenVINO environment. <br><br>
`source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh -pyver 3.6` . <br> 
<br>
#### NOTE -  Specify the pyver parameter according to your system. <br>

### Step 2 - 
Run the python file by passing in the required command line arguments. <br><br>

LINUX <br><br>
`python3 people_count.py -m path_to_model/person-detection-retail-0013/FP32/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l /opt/intel/openvino/inference_engine/lib/intel64/libcpu_extension_sse4.so -d CPU -pt 0.7`
<br><br>

WINDOWS <br><br>
`python3 people_count.py -m path_to_model/person-detection-retail-0013/FP32/person-detection-retail-0013.xml -l path_to_libCPU.dll -d CPU -pt 0.7`
<br>

Pass the path of the model to the -m parameter and pass the path of the library based on the device using the -l parameter.
If you are using Linux, you will find a .so file and If you are using Windows then you will find a .dll file.
There are separate library files for separate devices. 
For example, If you are using Linux then you will encounter these library files, among others  <br>

`libcpu_extension_sse4.so` <br>
`libHeteroPlugin.so` <br>
`libmyriadPlugin.so` <br>


#### NOTE - Make sure that you have properly installed and configured the OpenVINO toolkit before running the python program.

## Docker

To run this program in a docker container. Use the following command. <br><br>
`docker pull alpha10/open-vino-docker`
